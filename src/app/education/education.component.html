		<p><strong>Definition: Data Structures</strong></p>
		<p>Data structures are fundamental constructs used in computer science and software engineering to organize and store data efficiently. They define the way data is stored, accessed, and manipulated within a program. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure is designed for specific use cases, and choosing the right data structure is crucial for optimizing the performance of algorithms and applications. Understanding data structures is essential for writing efficient and scalable code in various programming languages.</p>
